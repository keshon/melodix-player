# Melodix Player — Self-hosted Discord music bot written in Go

Melodix Player is my pet project that plays audio from YouTube and audio streaming links to Discord voice channels.

![Playing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keshon/melodix-player/master/assets/demo.gif)

## Features Overview

### Playback Support
- Single track added by song name or YouTube link.
- Multiple tracks added via multiple YouTube links (space separated).
- Tracks from public user playlists.
- Tracks from "MIX" playlists.
- Streaming links (e.g., radio stations).

### Additional Features
- Operation across multiple Discord servers (guild management).
- Access to history of previously played tracks with sorting options.
- Downloading tracks from YouTube as mp3 files for caching.
- Sideloading audio mp3 files.
- Sideloading video files with audio extraction as mp3 files.
- Playback auto-resume support for connection interruptions.
- REST API support (limited at the moment).

### Current Limitations
- The bot cannot play YouTube streams.
- Playback auto-resume support creates noticeable pauses.
- Sometimes playback speed is slightly faster than intended.
- It's not bug-free.

## Try Melodix Player

You can test Melodix in two ways:
- Download [compiled binaries](https://github.com/keshon/melodix-player/releases) (available only for Windows). Ensure FFMPEG is installed on your system and added to the global PATH variable (or specify the path to FFMPEG directly in the `.env` config file). Follow the "Create bot in Discord Developer Portal" section to set up the bot in Discord.

- Join the [Official Discord server](https://discord.gg/NVtdTka8ZT) and use the voice and `#bot-spam` channels.

## Available Discord Commands

Melodix Player supports various commands with respective aliases (if applicable). Some commands require additional parameters.

!> 5  (assuming 5 is an ID from `!history`)
```
For adding a song to the queue, use:
```
!add Never Gonna Give You Up
!resume
```

## How to Set Up the Bot

### Create a Bot in the Discord Developer Portal
To add Melodix to a Discord server, follow these steps:

1. Create an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain the `APPLICATION_ID` (in the General section).
2. In the Bot section, enable `PRESENCE INTENT`, `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`, and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`.
3. Use the following link to authorize the bot: `discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID&scope=bot&permissions=36727824`
   - Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_ID` with your Bot's Application ID from step 1.
4. Select a server and click "Authorize".
5. Grant the necessary permissions for Melodix to function correctly (access to text and voice channels).

After adding the bot, build it from sources or download [compiled binaries](https://github.com/keshon/melodix-player/releases). Docker deployment instructions are available in `docker/README.md`.

### Building Melodix from Sources
This project is written in Go, so ensure your environment is ready. Use the provided scripts to build Melodix Player from sources:

- `build-release.bat` (or `.sh` for Linux): Build the release version.
- `assemble-dist.bat`: Build the release version and assemble it as a distribution package (Windows only).

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and store your Discord Bot Token in the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` variable. Install [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) (only recent versions are supported). If using a portable FFMPEG, specify the path in `DCA_FFMPEG_BINARY_PATH` in the `.env` file.
