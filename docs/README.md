## üîß How to Set Up the Bot

### üîó Create a Bot in the Discord Developer Portal
To add Melodix to a Discord server, follow these steps:

1. Create an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain the `APPLICATION_ID` (in the General section).
2. In the Bot section, enable `PRESENCE INTENT`, `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`, and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`.
3. Use the following link to authorize the bot: `discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID&scope=bot&permissions=36727824`
   - Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_ID` with your Bot's Application ID from step 1.
4. Select a server and click "Authorize".
5. Grant the necessary permissions for Melodix to function correctly (access to text and voice channels).

After adding the bot, build it from sources or download [compiled binaries](https://github.com/keshon/melodix-player/releases). Docker deployment instructions are available in `docker/README.md`.
